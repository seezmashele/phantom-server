# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple HTTP server using Go's standard library. The server will provide basic HTTP functionality with proper routing, middleware support, and configuration management. The implementation will leverage the existing folder structure and integrate with the current Go module setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start an HTTP server that listens on a configurable port, so that I can serve HTTP requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a config file
2. WHEN the config file specifies a port THEN the system SHALL use that port for the HTTP server
3. WHEN no config file exists or no port is specified THEN the system SHALL default to port 8080
4. WHEN the server starts successfully THEN the system SHALL log the listening address
5. WHEN the server fails to start THEN the system SHALL log an error and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define HTTP routes with handlers, so that I can respond to different HTTP endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to "/" THEN the system SHALL respond with a welcome message
2. WHEN a GET request is made to "/health" THEN the system SHALL respond with a health check status
3. WHEN a request is made to an undefined route THEN the system SHALL respond with a 404 status
4. WHEN any route handler executes THEN the system SHALL log the request method and path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement middleware for common functionality, so that I can add cross-cutting concerns like logging and CORS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any HTTP request is received THEN the system SHALL log the request details (method, path, timestamp)
2. WHEN any HTTP response is sent THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN middleware encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing
4. WHEN multiple middleware are applied THEN the system SHALL execute them in the correct order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize the server code using the existing folder structure, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows Go best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing handlers THEN the system SHALL place them in the internal/handlers directory
2. WHEN implementing middleware THEN the system SHALL place them in the internal/middleware directory
3. WHEN implementing routes THEN the system SHALL place route definitions in the internal/routes directory
4. WHEN implementing configuration THEN the system SHALL place config logic in the internal/config directory
5. WHEN creating a config file THEN the system SHALL support JSON format for easy editing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to handle graceful shutdown, so that ongoing requests can complete before the server stops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shutdown signal is received THEN the system SHALL stop accepting new requests
2. WHEN shutting down THEN the system SHALL wait for ongoing requests to complete with a timeout
3. WHEN the shutdown timeout is reached THEN the system SHALL force close remaining connections
4. WHEN shutdown completes THEN the system SHALL log the shutdown completion
